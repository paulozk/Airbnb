# Amsterdam Airbnbs 
This repository contains tools for exploring and processing Airbnb data gathered from Airbnbs in Amsterdam from AirBnB.com. Processing includes:
* Data Cleaning: Dealing with inconsistencies in the data, such as non-uniform markers for missing values
* Visualization: Visualize insights into the data (per district) and offer this via an interactive dashboard (Flask + Dash)
* Data Preprocessing: Transforming the data to make it machine-readable, so that it can be fed to a machine learning model
