This repository contains tools for exploring and processing Airbnb data gathered from Airbnbs in Amsterdam. Processing includes:
* Data Cleaning: to deal with non-uniform markers for missing values
* Visualization: Visualize insights into the data and offer this via a dashboard (Flask + Dash)
* Data Preprocessing: Transforming the data to make it machine-readable, so that it can be fed to a machine learning model
